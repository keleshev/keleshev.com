This is a permalink for the book's resources.
Services like GitHub and Discourse come and go out of fashion, so I wanted to make sure that the link that I put in the book is under my control, so you, the reader, can reach it even if I switch repository or forum hosting services.

## Source code

The source code is available on GitHub:

## Discussion forum

The book used to have a dedicated discussion forum, but it didn't see much use, so it was discontinued.
For posterity, here's the archive:

I can recommend to use Reddit communities r/Compilers and r/ProgrammingLanguages to discuss the book:
