  <h1><big>Say No</big><br/><small>to Human-AI Workflow Segregation</small></h1>

<p>One trend that surpised me a lot recently, something that happens both at work and in open-source, is people <em>suddenly</em> starting doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing a lot of relevant, long-overdue, sharp, concise, to-the-point documentation… but placing it in <code>copilot-instructions.md</code> or <code>AGENTS.md</code> files.</li>
<li>Implementing extremely valuable workflows, but exposing them in form of <code>skills</code> or <abbr title="Model Context Protocol">MCP</abbr> servers.</li>
<li>Improving output of tests and other command-line tools, but hiding it under AI-oriented flags and environmental variables (like <code>AI=true</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, I think we need a deep breath and take a step back.</p>
<p>Yes, good documentation <em>is</em> valuable for AI agents, especially if it is not part of the training data set. A good documentation <em>digest</em> is often even more important, because it takes less of the context window. But… that documentation is equally valuable for humans, and we have a limited context window too, and benefit from good summaries equally.</p>
<p>Next, tools. There are tools that are mostly human-oriented, tools with graphical user interfaces. Then there are new kinds of tools that are mostly AI-oriented, the MCP tools. However, there’s a set of tools that both developers and AI agents prefer alike: command-line tools. They are scriptable, composable, text-only, and can perfectly expose functionality to both humans and AI agents. Why not focus on them?</p>
<p>I’ve seen a case where an MCP tool was introduced because the actual command-line tool took a lot of time to execute, was producing no output and was often terminated early by the agent. That reminds me of someone else who is also liable to that… I am! Well, who, when running a new tool and presented with a hanging command-line, doesn’t just Ctrl-C out of it if nothing happens for 10 seconds?</p>
<p>Who is overwhelmed when a tool produces tons of unnecessary output? I am. And it makes AI context window slide and leave out potentially more useful information. Mental overload, anyone?</p>
<p>Who likes it when tests execute fast and, if they fail, produce output that allows to easily narrow down the problem? You get the idea…</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Let’s sum it up in a few guidelines:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Place documentation where both human developers and AI agents can expect it. For example, in <code>README.md</code>, not <code>AGENTS.md</code>.</li>
<li>Prefer exposing functionality as command-line tools, which are equally well accessible to humans and AI agents, over GUI and MCP tools.</li>
<li>Avoid parameters (command-line, environment, etc.) that segregate workflows between humans and AI agents, e.g. avoid <code>AI=true</code>, prefer <code>--quiet</code> or, even better design your tools with context/mental-overload in mind.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know that there are a few technicalities involved, for example, some tools will pre-load files like <code>AGENTS.md</code> into the context, but this actual conventions are changing rapidly, often vendor-specific (e.i. not to be relied upon), and most of the benefit can be obtained by placing “See <code>README.md</code>” in them.</p>
<hr />
<p>It has become a cliché to say that LLMs are humanity’s mirror: malleable, fallible, easy to fool, based on tech that mimics some of our tech, and shares a lot of training data with us. I think we should embrace the situation and try stay interoperable as long as possible, but the ramifications are not lost on me.</p>
